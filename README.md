Run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`.

Configuring git
---------------

### Using HTTPS with git-credential-manager

The dotfiles include configuration for secure credential storage using git-credential-manager and pass-secret-service:

1. Initialize the password store (only needed once):
   ```
   $ pass init YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID
   ```

2. Authentication workflow:
   - First-time authentication: You'll be prompted to enter a Personal Access Token (PAT)
   - PAT is securely stored in the pass password store via GPG encryption
   - Future authentications will use the stored PAT automatically
   - No browser-based auth - uses CLI-based token entry only

3. The configuration in home/cgeorgii.nix includes:
   ```nix
   credential = {
     helper = "manager";
     credentialStore = "gpg";
   };
   ```

Connecting to Wi-Fi
------------------

### Using NetworkManager TUI
1. Open the network manager interface:
   ```
   $ nmtui-connect
   ```

2. Select your Wi-Fi network from the list
3. Enter the network password when prompted

### Handling Captive Portals (Hotel/Airport Wi-Fi)
For networks that require browser login (captive portals):

1. Connect to the network using nmtui-connect first
2. Open the captive portal browser:
   ```
   $ captive-browser
   ```
3. Complete the login process in the browser window that opens

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues
- If experiencing connection problems, try disabling any active VPN connections first
- VPNs can interfere with initial network authentication and captive portal access
- Re-enable VPN after successfully connecting to the network

ZSA Keyboard Firmware Flashing
------------------------------

This system includes support for ZSA keyboards (Ergodox EZ, Moonlander, etc.) with the Wally CLI tool for firmware updates.

### Flashing Firmware
1. Download your firmware file (.bin) from [ZSA Oryx](https://configure.zsa.io/)
2. Connect your keyboard via USB
3. Put the keyboard in flash mode:
   - **Moonlander**: Press and hold the small button on the left side while plugging in
4. Flash the firmware:
   ```
   $ wally-cli path/to/your/firmware.bin
   ```

### Example Usage
```bash
# Download firmware from Oryx and flash it
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ wally-cli moonlander_layout_v2.bin
Flashing ZSA keyboard...
Device found: Moonlander
Flashing firmware... done!
```

### Troubleshooting
- If the device isn't detected, ensure it's in flash mode (small button pressed during connection)
- USB permissions are automatically configured through the ZSA udev rules
- The keyboard will restart automatically after successful flashing
